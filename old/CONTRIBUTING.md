- [We believe](https://www.trustroots.org/about) in beauty, simplicity and transparency.
- We emphasize community.

## Not a discussion forum

GitHub issues are not a general discussion forum. This is a forum for technical discussion about how to implement features, questions of a technical nature, reporting bugs, and so on.

It is not a place for policy discussion. Personal opinion about which features are important, which features should or should not be implemented, and so on, does not belong here.

We operate a 3 strike policy. 1st warning, 2nd warning, blocked.

## Be pragmatic

We value getting things done attitude. Arguments about minor issues shouldn't get in the way of getting work done and achieving more important results. Use the tools and methods which help getting the job done. Let decisions be taken by people who do the work.

## Real life interaction

We highly value real life interaction. Both within the network as well as among technical contributors. If possible, try to meet up with other Trustroots contributors in real life. You can connect your Trustroots profile to your GitHub account to facilitate such connections.
