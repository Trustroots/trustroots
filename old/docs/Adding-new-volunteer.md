# Adding new volunteers to our systems

Remember that starting volunteering is hard! Handhold folks as much as possible, and work on making them feel welcome and included. With experienced volunteers, be mindful of [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) they might feel. Konstant encouragement and celebration of jobs well done is important.

## Steps to take when adding new volunteers

### For everyone

- Add _volunteer_ role in admin tool. At Trustroots admin tool, find their profile and add "volunteer" role to them. This won't give them any special access, but it makes folks show up at [the team page](https://www.trustroots.org/team) and highlights them as volunteers in their profile. This is important for trust, so that community members can check if they're dealing with someone who truly is with Trustroots.
- Ensure they're invited in [volunteer chat](./Chat.md).
- Ask them [to request account at the wiki](https://wiki.trustroots.org/en/Special:RequestAccount), which you then need to [accept from the list](https://wiki.trustroots.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ConfirmAccounts/authors&wpShowHeld=0).

### Working on social media

- Give access to specific social media accounts. Each account should have shared `@trustroots.org` email so that they're not locked behind individuals. Passwords are kept in LastPass — ask [Mikael](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/mikael).
- Invite to #social-media channel on Slack.

### Working on newsletter or blog

- Give them "Editor" level access to blog [by inviting with their email](https://wordpress.com/people/new/ideas.trustroots.org).
- MailPoet access is together with the blog.
- See [newsletter docs](./Newsletter.md) for more.
- Invite to #newsletter channel on Slack.

### Translators

- Point them at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/trustroots/) for translations. Ensure their language is listed there, and add them admin access if needed.
- See [translation docs](./Translating-Getting-Started.md) for more.
- Invite to #i18n channel on Slack.

### Support volunteers

- Ask them to sign NDA because they will have access to private member data, see more below.
- Add _admin_ role in admin tool. This will give them access to Trustroots admin tool.
- Add them to private `#safety` channel on Slack.
- Add them to ["Safety" team on Github](https://github.com/orgs/Trustroots/teams/safety) — this will give them access to few private repositories with more information.
- Create them a ZD account. (Ask [Mikael](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/mikael))

### For developers

- Add them to ["Devs" team on Github](https://github.com/orgs/Trustroots/teams/devs) — this will give them push access to relevant repositories.
- See [guide for developers](./Development-Getting-Starte.md) for more.

### For developers dealing with live server

- Create an account at server and give sudo rights.
- Additionally, if needed, give access to DigitalOcean, Sparkpost, Mapbox, or other systems they need to get the work done.
- Ask them to sign NDA because they will have access to private member data, see more below.

## NDA

- There's a template in Google Drive.
- Ask Mikael to send it for signing for each person who has access to private member data.
- Store the signed NDA in Google Drive.
- Mark at admin tool at user's profile the date when they signed NDA.
