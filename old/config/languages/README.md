# Languages

The `languages.json` is a custom made file which contains languages from `languages_orig.json` that has `iso_639_2` standard defined.

cd to this directory (`config/languages`) and type `node generate.js`

### Todo

- See [Missing languages](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/98)
- If the search input for languages can one day handle 7000+ items, we can include all the living languages and dialects. Until that we're limiting this to ~500 or so.
