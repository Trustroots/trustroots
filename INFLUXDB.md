# InfluxDB Statistics

So you enabled [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) statistics. Hopefully you run version 1.0+. If not, stop now and upgrade.

Here you can read what data are collected and what queries you can run.

## See the data

You can use InfluxDB admin panel or install [Grafana](http://grafana.org/)

### Admin panel

When `influxd` or influx service is running, open [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)

### Grafana

By default Grafana runs on port 3000. In order to solve the conflict with trustroots application you need to change the default port in configuration.

- [locate your grafana configuration file](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#config-file-locations)
- find, uncomment and change `http_port` value according to your preference
- save the changes and start/restart the grafana server (i.e. `systemctl start grafana`, it is system specific)
- run the client on localhost:(your-value)
- [ ] we'll provide a dashboard which you can import and use with the data.

## Metrics

[Read more about how to query InfluxDB.](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/) On the website look for more chapters in Contents.

### Messages

These are the data stored for every message in InfluxDB

```js
measurement: 'messageSent'
time

fields: {
  messageId: string,
  idFrom: string,
  idTo: string,
  messageLength: number, // counting only plainText of the message content
  replyTime: number [ms], // field time between the first message and the first reply
                          // available only for "position"='firstReply', otherwise -1
}

tags: {
  messageLengthType: string, // (short|long)
  position: string, // (first|firstReply|other) position in the thread
}
```

#### Amounts

##### How many messages are sent weekly?

```
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
```

#### Reply rate

##### How many new threads are started? How many new threads are replied?

```
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND position = 'first' GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND position = 'firstReply' GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
```

##### What is the ratio at given time?

_Note: Messages and replies are decoupled in the database. Here we show the ratio between amount of new threads written now and first replies replied now._

- counting data to a new measurement `messageRatio` with SELECT INTO

```
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) AS firstMessageCount INTO messageRatio FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w position='first' GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) AS firstReplyCount INTO messageRatio FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w position='firstReply' GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
```

- comparing the data

```
SELECT SUM(firstReplyCount)/SUM(firstMessageCount) AS percent FROM messageRatio WHERE time > now() - 100w GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
```

- keeping the messageRatio updated with CONTINUOUS QUERIES

```
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY "firstMessageCountCQ" ON "trustroots" RESAMPLE FOR 2w BEGIN SELECT COUNT(messageLength) AS firstMessageCount INTO messageRatio FROM messageSent WHERE position='first' GROUP BY time(1w) END
```

... and similarly for `firstReplyCount`.

#### Reply time

##### What is the time since the first message till the first reply?

- Average reply time may be interesting:

```
SELECT MEAN(replyTime) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND position='firstReply' GROUP BY time(1w)
```

- Median reply time will be influenced less by very late replies.

```
SELECT MEDIAN(replyTime) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND position='firstReply' GROUP BY time(1w)
```

##### How many replies are useful (replied within 1,3,7,14 days)?

```
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND position = 'firstReply' AND replyTime < 24*3600*1000 GROUP BY time(1w) fill(0)
```

#### Message length

##### How frequent are long and short messages?

```
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND messageLengthType='short' GROUP BY time(1w)
SELECT COUNT(messageLength) FROM messageSent WHERE time > now() - 100w AND messageLengthType='long' GROUP BY time(1w)
```

##### What is the ratio?

_To be continued..._

You can also filter by the position in the thread. You can try to write your own query which will show average and median message length.
