  <h3>What's your legal status?</h3>
  The website is owned and operated by <a ui-sref="foundation">Trustroots Foundation</a>, a non-profit Limited by Guarantee (LBG) under section 60 exemption, registered in the United Kingdom in March 2015.

<div class="faq-question" id="why-limited-by-guarantee">
  <h3>Why Limited by Guarantee under section 60 exemption?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s fast and relatively affordable to set up.</li>
    <li>It’s possible to apply for CIC status, which is a special form recently created for social enterprises<del></del>.</li>
    <li>It is very flexible, this is why many NGOs and charities choose the LBG form.</li>
    <li>Additionally, section 60 exemption from the obligation to have name ending with “limited” <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/62">requires</a> that:
  <ul>
    <li>The company purposes are for the public benefit.</li>
    <li>It is a non for profit.</li>
    <li>Assets are to be specially protected on winding up.</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using the word Foundation in the name also requires that any profits should be used to further the objects of the company and not paid to the members as dividends.</li>
  </ul>

  Some typical LBGs in the UK would be clubs and membership organisations such as workers’ co-operatives, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and charities. For example the <a href="https://www.osmfoundation.org/">OpenStreetMap Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.hackspace.org.uk/">UK Hackspace Foundation</a> are LGBs.

<div class="faq-question" id="are-you-going-to-sell-out">
  <h3>Could Trustroots assets be sold?</h3>
  The guarantee of LBG under section 60 requires a clause where in case of Trustroots Foundation ceasing to exist, assets could be moved only to another non-profit entity where transferring assets is limited in the same way. CIC status would make this even more specific, but isn’t required for this.
  <br><br>
  Additionally our by-laws (articles of association) specifically prohibit selling the users database and specify that the company code will be licensed under an <a href="https://github.com/trustroots/trustroots/#license">open source license</a>.

  <h3>How do you want to make the project financially sustainable?</h3>
  <a ui-sref="donate">Donations</a> and grants are the most likely ways. There are many inspiring organisations out there serving as great examples: <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.abgefahren-ev.de/">Abgefahren e.V.</a> (Hitchwiki), <a href="https://www.bevolunteer.org/">BeVolunteer</a>, <a href="http://www.servas.org/">Servas</a>, <a href="http://www.wwoof.net/">WWOOF</a> and many more. Again, if you have experience with this it would be great if you <a ui-sref="support">contact us</a>.

<div class="faq-question" id="who-decides-what-gets-done">
  <h3>Who decides what gets done?</h3>
  Anyone can join us as a <a ui-sref="volunteering">volunteer</a>. We're huge fans of do-cracy and getting things done attitude. We have <a ui-sref="team">a core team</a> which is formed from the most active volunteers. There isn't voting or other buraucratic processes involved, but you get more responsibility by simply becoming active contributor and showing your communication skills. Great community values simple translation jobs just as much as highly skilled development. We'll aim to keep the entry level for volunteers as low as possible. No bureaucracy. Pragmatic approach. Trust.
  <br><br>
  That said, any well organized project needs efficient teams working on specific issues (such as <i>safety</i> or site's <i>features/UX</i>). Rather than building complicated voting mechanisms or other structures, we'll try to concentrate in fostering volunteers into responsible, skilled teams. It's also important to make sure everyone has the same goal and vision.
