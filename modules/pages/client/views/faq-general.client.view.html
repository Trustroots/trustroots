<div class="faq-question" id="is-trustroots-exclusively-for-hitchhikers">
  <h3>Is Trustroots exclusively for hitchhikers?</h3>
  No. Trustroots is for everyone.
  <br><br>
  Trustroots was initially built with hitchhikers in mind but anyone has always been welcome to sign up even if they've never hitchhiked.
  <br><br>
  In the initial phase we were focusing on getting especially hitchhikers on board and making the site ideal for that. Our background is within Hitchhikers community and in <a href="http://hitchwiki.org/">Hitchwiki</a>. The site will obviously remain rather alternative and true to its roots, even when we introduce it to new communities.

<div class="faq-question" id="is-trustroots-alternative">
  <h3>Is Trustroots an alternative for CouchSurfing or BeWelcome?</h3>
  Trustroots isn't on purpose an alternative to anything specifically. There are many people to whom Facebook, CouchSurfing or other tools aren't suitable for multitude of reasons. We encourage using any tools you wish in parallel. We are trying to make it easy to gather your contents from these sites also to Trustroots.

<div class="faq-question" id="how-is-this-connected-to-hitchwiki-nomadwiki-or-trashwiki">
  <h3>How is this connected to Hitchwiki, Nomadwiki or Trashwiki?</h3>
  The team creating Trustroots also created these projects. We will want to look into integrating them to some degree into Trustroots since they share pretty much the same vision and user base.

<div class="faq-question" id="why-the-name-trustroots">
  <h3>Why the name Trustroots?</h3>
  Back to the roots. Earthy. The art of asking — and trusting — is something we often experience while traveling. We also have some innovative ideas that can help building trust among people. Once the network is big enough we'd love to work with scientists to build something that can really make a difference through trust metrics.

<div class="faq-question" id="why-is-there-facebook-connection">
  <h3>Why is there Facebook connection?</h3>
  So that people who have their data, photos and connections on Facebook can release their information to Trustroots. Using Facebook from Trustroots is optional. <a href="https://ideas.trustroots.org/2014/12/29/life-outside-big-blue-box/">Read our blog post</a> about this.

<div class="faq-question" id="why-is-there-no-forum">
  <h3>Why is there no forum?</h3>
  The practical answer: it takes time to set up a forum and even more time to keep it spam-free. The less practical answer: In our long-term and short-term experience forum activity is not necessarily the best way to get to more real life interactions. In the long term we do want to provide a way to communicate on the site, but this will probably look more like the quick and easy way you can interact on Facebook or Diaspora than a full fledged forum.
  <br><br>
  We have set up a forum for Hitchwiki though, <a href="https://talk.hitchwiki.org/">have a look!</a>
