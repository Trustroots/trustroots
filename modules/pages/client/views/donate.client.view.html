        Trustroots is run entirely by donations. We are a non-profit
        <a ui-sref="foundation">foundation</a> registered in the United Kingdom
        in March 2015.
      </p>

      <h4>How will my donation be used?</h4>
      <p>
        Most our expenses are tech related; servers, services, domains and
        bandwidth. Additionally we have expenses from governing the foundation,
        such as legal consultation, handling our finances and accounting. In the
        future we consider paying salaries to get some of the work done. This
        said, we're mainly a volunteer organisation and that won't change. We
        are working on opening up our expenditures and governance soon.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Is my donation tax deductible?</h4>
      <p>Unfortunately not at the moment.</p>
      <br />

      <h4>Which currencies do you accept?</h4>
      <p>
        You can donate via PayPal, which currently accepts nearly two dozen
        currencies.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Can I donate bitcoin?</h4>
      <p>Yes!</p>
      <br />

      <h4>
        Iâ€™m unable to give money at this time, are there other ways I can help?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yes! <a ui-sref="volunteering">Become a volunteer</a> and make a
        difference.
