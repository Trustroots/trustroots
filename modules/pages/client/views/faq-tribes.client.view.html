  <h3>What are Tribes?</h3>
  Trustroots Tribes are a way for you to immediately find the people you will
  easily connect with.
  <br /><br />
  You can start now by joining <a ui-sref="tribes.list">Tribes</a> that you
  identify yourself with. <br /><br />
  When searching for hosts, you can filter members by tribes.
  <br /><br />
  Your tribes will also show up in your profile, telling others more about you.
  <br /><br />
  We'll aim to add ways to the site that will fill your trips and your life with
  adventure! Imagine walking around in a city you're visiting for the first time
  and suddently you start receiving invitations from people to stay with them or
  go to awesome or inspiring events, or just to a dumpster dive dinner. That's
  the adventure Trustroots wants to enable. And Tribes is a step towards this.
