            understand as possible. We are committed to being transparent and
            open. This article explains generally how we receive information
            about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.</em

        <h3>Your data is yours</h3>

        Users on Trustroots can download their profile, contact and hosting data
        through the <span ng-if="!app.user">Account settings</span
        ><a ui-sref="profile-edit.account" ng-if="app.user">Account settings</a
        >.

        <br /><br />

        You are able to remove your info from the system by asking us to delete
        your account through the <span ng-if="!app.user">Account settings</span
        ><a ui-sref="profile-edit.account" ng-if="app.user">Account settings</a
        >.

        <br /><br />

        We will never, ever sell your profile data to anyone or try to otherwise
        use it commercially.

        <h3>Information about you</h3>
        This information is collected when you provide it to us (like when you
        fill your profile) or use features of our service (like messaging).

        <br /><br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            Basic profile information such as name, email, language, name,
            picture, gender, age, living location, usernames in other networks.
          </li>
          <li>Messages from and to other members</li>
          <li>Information about you from other members; references</li>
          <li>
            Information from 3rd party once you connect your account to them
          </li>
        </ul>

        Via mobile devices you may also share content to Trustroots via your
        device's camera, location sensor or address book. This data is never
        published or used without your consent and it is always clarified when
        you are about to give this information to us.

        <h3>Analytics &amp; opting out</h3>

        <p>
          Using Analytics we automatically collect information such as usage
          times, browser details, screen size, network location (IP), country,
          language etc. This information is anonymized and never published so
          that individual users cannot be recognized.
        </p>

        <p>
          We currently use <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, as it's the
          industry standard. At some point in the future we would like to run
          our own instance of Matomo and after doing that for long enough we may
          be able to move away from Google Analytics. We can use
          <a ui-sref="volunteering">help</a> with this.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also use third-party services that probably track usage, this
          includes
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gravatar, for profile images</li>
          <li>Facebook, for profile images</li>
          <li>
            Google Firebase, for mobile and browser push notifications.
            Unfortunately there's no "open source way" of doing push
            notifications to mobile platforms, they always go through platform's
            own servers (basically Apple for iPhone or Google for Android, and
            each browser vendor for browsers). That's why if you download the
            mobile app
            <a href="http://apk.trustroots.org/"
              >directly from us as an APK file</a
            >, you won't get push notifications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Like with Google Analytics, we would like to reduce our reliance on
          these services in the future, and we can definitely use
          <a ui-sref="volunteering">help</a> with this.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        Trustroots uses
        <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to
        collect usage, device and browser statistics.

        <br /><br />

        To opt out of analytics tracking, you can either:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Install Google's official
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
              >opt out extension</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Install <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>,
            <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/"
              >Noscript</a
            >, <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> or
            <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a>. These
            browser extensions will disable all known JavaScript trackers and
            ensure that your browser does not send a request to external
            tracking servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        If you wish to stay completely anonymous online, please check this guide

        >.

        <h3>Social networks</h3>

        Some of the features on Trustroots use other social networks such as
        Twitter, Facebook, GitHub or Gravatar. You don't have to connect your
        profile to these and we don't share any data with these networks. We
        only crawl information you give us access to and show it on your profile
        if you want to. Some of the data from these sites is then stored on our
        server.

        <br /><br />

        Some of our users want to use these networks and they have a right to do
        so. Others prefer to steer away from these networks and we'll also
        accommodate these users.

        <h3>Your emails</h3>

        We route all our emails using
        <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">SparkPost</a> servers.

        <h3>Our server</h3>

        Our server (and thus your data) is securely hosted at
        <a
          href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=6dc078966c9c"
          title="(Referral link)"
          >DigitalOcean</a
        >
        in Amsterdam, Europe.

        <h3>Research</h3>

        Scientific trust metric research might be done with Trustroots data, but
        in such case the data is always anonymized and it will be impossible to
        recognize individual users from it. See our
        <a ui-sref="statistics">statistics page</a> for more information.
