        <h3>Your data is yours</h3>

        Users on Trustroots can download their profile, contact and hosting data through the <span ng-if="!app.user">Account settings</span><a ui-sref="profile-settings" ng-if="app.user">Account settings</a>.

        <br><br>

        In the future, you will be able to remove your profile from the system. The feature itself is in development. Currently, you can ask us to delete your account.

        <br><br>

        We will never, ever sell your profile data to anyone or try to otherwise use it commercially.


        <h3>Analytics & opting out</h3>

        Trustroots uses <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to collect usage statistics. We use <a href="https://www.unionstationapp.com/">Union Station</a> to monitor site and server performance.

        <br><br>

        To opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you can install Google's official <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out extension</a>. To opt-out of all tracking (including Google Analytics and Piwik), you can install <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">Noscript</a> or <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a>. These browser extensions will disable all known JavaScript trackers and ensure that your browser does not send a request to external tracking servers.

        <h3>Social networks</h3>

        Some of the features on Trustroots use other social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub or Gravatar. You don't have to connect your profile to these and we don't share any data with these networks. We only crawl information you give us access to and show it on your profile if you want to. Some of the data from these sites is then stored on our server.

        <br><br>

        Some of our users want to use these networks and they have a right to do so. Others prefer to steer away from these networks and we'll also accommodate these users.

        <h3>Your emails</h3>

        We route all our emails using <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">SparkPost</a>.

        <h3>Our server</h3>

        Our server (and thus your data) is securely hosted at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=6dc078966c9c" title="(Referral link)">DigitalOcean</a> and backed up hourly to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.
