          We&apos;re huge fans of do-cracy and getting things done attitude. We

          active volunteers. There isn&apos;t voting or other buraucratic
          processes involved, but you get more responsibility by simply becoming
          active contributor and showing your communication skills. Great
          community values simple translation jobs just as much as highly
          skilled development. We&apos;ll aim to keep the entry level for
          volunteers as low as possible. No bureaucracy. Pragmatic approach.
