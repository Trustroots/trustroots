    Hello {{userTo.firstName}},
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="{{userFromProfileUrl}}">{{userFrom.displayName}}</a> has shared their experience with you on Trustroots.
  </p>

  <p>
    Would you like to share yours as well? You can <a href="{{giveExperienceUrl}}">write about your experience</a> and both experiences will become public right after that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not in the mood to do it now? You have {{days}} days to share your experience with them. After that their experience will become public and you will only be able to share your experience with limited choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you think this message is an error or if you donâ€™t know this person, <a href="{{supportUrl}}">let us know</a> so our Trust & Safety team can look into it.
