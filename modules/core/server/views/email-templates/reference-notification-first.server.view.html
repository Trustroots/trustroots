    Hello {{userTo.firstName}}!
  </p>

  <p>
    Great news! <a href="{{userFromProfileUrl}}">{{userFrom.firstName}}</a> left you a reference on Trustroots.
  </p>

  <p>You will be able to see their reference after you leave them a reference as well.</p>

  <p>
    You have two weeks to do this.
    After two weeks, their reference for you will become public
    and you will only be able to give them a positive reference.
  </p>
