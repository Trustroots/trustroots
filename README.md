Trust Roots is developed using MEAN.js boilerplate is based on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites:
* [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm: `npm install -g bower`
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task runner to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Cloning repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots.git trustroots
```
This will clone the latest version of the Trust Roots repository to a **trustroots** folder.

### Downloading the repository zip file
```
$ wget https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/archive/master.zip -O trustroots.zip; unzip trustroots.zip; rm trustroots.zip
```

## Quick Install
Install the Node.js dependencies.

Run this inside **trustroots** folder:
```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application.

## Running Your Application
After the install, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

...that equals to:
```
$ NODE_ENV=development grunt default
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Development and deployment With Docker

* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)
* Install [Fig](https://github.com/orchardup/fig)

* Local development and testing with fig:
```bash
$ fig up
```

* Local development and testing with just Docker:
```bash
$ docker build -t trustroots .
$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 trustroots
$
```

* To enable live reload forward 35729 port and mount /app and /public as volumes:
```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /path/to/trustroots/public:/home/trustroots/public -v /path/to/trustroots/app:/home/trustroots/app --link db:db_1 trustroots
```

## Getting Started With Trust Roots Development
* [Github](https://github.com/Trustroots/)
* See [Offical Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html) for MEAN.js
* [Our docs](documentation/README.md)
* Install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if possible

### Understand these
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), particularly [The Express Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html); you can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.
