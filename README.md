## Volunteering

[developers.trustroots.org](http://developers.trustroots.org/)

You don't have the be a programmer to participate. Check [volunteers page](https://www.trustroots.org/volunteering) for more info.

## Installing

We have two major ways of running the software:


### Installing locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS. This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration, but is super fast, and can be easier to work with. See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.


### Installing with Docker

The easiest and quickest way to get started is with Docker. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for further details. Running through Docker can be a little bit slower.
