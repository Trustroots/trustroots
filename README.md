## Maintenance mode

Trustroots is in maintenance mode. No new features are being developed. Our
medium term plan is decentralisation, more on that will be published soon.

## Building for production

See `deploy/docker`. Run `dockerBuild.sh`. Then `docker push` the latest tags
which are output as the last part of the `dockerBuild.sh` script.
