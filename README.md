## Running the software

We have two main ways to run the software.

### Running locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS and MongoDB locally.
This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration,
but is fast, and can be easier to work with. [Read more](https://developers.trustroots.org/Install.html).

### Running with Docker

If you are familiar with Docker, this is the easiest and quickest way
to get started. Running Docker can be a little bit slower than running locally. [Read more](https://developers.trustroots.org/Install-Docker.html).
