## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Member search and role filtering

The system SHALL let authorised administrators search for members and list
members with a selected moderation role. Search queries SHALL ignore leading
and trailing whitespace, and whitespace between query words SHALL be optional
when matching stored member data. Member collections SHALL be paginated and
server-side sortable by name, username, email address, signup date, or current
IP address. The selected sort order SHALL be retained while an administrator
moves between pages.

#### Scenario: Administrator searches for a member

- **WHEN** an authorised administrator searches using a valid member query
- **THEN** the first page of matching member records is displayed

#### Scenario: Administrator searches with surrounding whitespace

- **WHEN** an authorised administrator searches using a valid member query
  with leading or trailing whitespace
- **THEN** the system searches using the trimmed query

#### Scenario: Administrator searches with spacing between words

- **WHEN** an authorised administrator searches using words separated by
  whitespace
- **THEN** matching member data is returned whether it stores whitespace
  between those words or not

- **AND** the URL retains the role while the administrator changes pages or sorting

#### Scenario: Administrator follows a member role link

- **WHEN** an administrator selects the Greeter or volunteer role on a member record
- **THEN** the application opens the corresponding role-filtered member list at its unique URL

#### Scenario: Administrator sorts member search results

- **WHEN** an authorised administrator selects a member-table column header
- **THEN** the displayed member collection is sorted by that column on the server
- **AND** selecting the active header again reverses the sort direction

#### Scenario: Administrator opens another member-list page

- **WHEN** an authorised administrator selects a subsequent or previous page
- **THEN** the system displays that page of the same member collection
