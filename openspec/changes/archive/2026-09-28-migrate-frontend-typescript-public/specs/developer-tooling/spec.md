## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Public pages and statistics client code use TypeScript

The project SHALL implement the public pages and statistics client modules in strict TypeScript while preserving their existing runtime behaviour and client test coverage.

#### Scenario: A public page or statistics module is type-checked

- **WHEN** the client TypeScript type-check runs
- **THEN** public pages and statistics client modules are included in the strict check
- **AND** those modules contain no unchecked JavaScript implementations

#### Scenario: Public pages or statistics code is covered by client tests

- **WHEN** the client test suite and coverage run
- **THEN** the migrated modules remain exercised by their existing tests
- **AND** the established client coverage thresholds remain satisfied
