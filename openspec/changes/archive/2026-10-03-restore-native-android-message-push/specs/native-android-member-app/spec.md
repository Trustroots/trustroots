# Native Android Member App Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Native Android message alerts

The Android app SHALL let signed-in members opt in to unread-message alerts
through an installed UnifiedPush distributor. It SHALL request notification
permission when required, register only the current account's device, and
remove that registration on opt-out or sign-out. Tapping an alert SHALL open
the relevant conversation. The app SHALL remain usable without a distributor.

#### Scenario: Member enables alerts

- **WHEN** a signed-in member enables message alerts
- **THEN** the app requests notification permission when required
- **AND** helps the member select an installed distributor
- **AND** registers its endpoint for that member

#### Scenario: Member changes account on one device

- **WHEN** a member signs out and another member signs in on the same device
- **THEN** the previous member's registration is removed
- **AND** the new member is not registered until they opt in

#### Scenario: Member taps an unread-message alert

- **WHEN** a member taps an Android unread-message alert
- **THEN** the app opens the matching conversation after checking their session

#### Scenario: No distributor is installed

- **WHEN** the member has no UnifiedPush distributor on their device
- **THEN** native messaging remains usable and no background alert is promised
