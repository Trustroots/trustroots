## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Opt-in native usage analytics

The Android app SHALL default to sending no native analytics, including in F-Droid builds. It SHALL offer equally accessible enable and disable controls on sign-in and Account, explain the data and destination, and persist consent locally across restarts. Consent SHALL be independent of the signed-in account.

#### Scenario: Fresh installation

- **WHEN** the app opens or navigates before consent
- **THEN** no native analytics requests are sent

#### Scenario: Member opts in

- **WHEN** the member enables usage analytics
- **THEN** subsequent foreground app opens and native top-level screen views are sent to the self-hosted Trustroots Umami endpoint
- **AND** native traffic uses `android.trustroots.org`, fixed `/android/` paths and the existing production website identifier
- **AND** requests contain no credentials, cookies, member data, message data, user-entered values, browser URLs or persistent identifiers

#### Scenario: Member opts out

- **WHEN** the member disables usage analytics
- **THEN** pending requests are cancelled and subsequent events are discarded
- **AND** the choice remains disabled after restarting

#### Scenario: Analytics service is unavailable

- **WHEN** delivery fails or times out
- **THEN** app navigation and authentication continue normally
- **AND** events are not persisted, retried or redirected to another host
