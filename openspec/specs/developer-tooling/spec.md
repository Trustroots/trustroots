# developer-tooling Specification

## Purpose

Define build and verification requirements for languages used in Trustroots client code so incremental changes remain testable and visible to CI.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Client TypeScript support

The project SHALL compile client `.ts` and `.tsx` modules used by the current application and SHALL type-check those modules in CI without requiring existing JavaScript to pass TypeScript checking.

#### Scenario: JavaScript imports a converted client utility

- **WHEN** a JavaScript client module imports a converted TypeScript utility without a file extension
- **THEN** the development and production bundles resolve and compile the utility
- **AND** client tests can import and exercise it

#### Scenario: A client TypeScript file contains a type error

- **WHEN** the type-check command runs in CI
- **THEN** the command fails on that error

### Requirement: Client tooling retains TypeScript visibility

The project SHALL include client TypeScript and TSX in linting, test discovery, coverage collection and translation extraction where those tools apply.

#### Scenario: A translated client module is converted to TypeScript

- **WHEN** translation extraction runs
- **THEN** its translation keys are still extracted

#### Scenario: A covered client module is converted to TypeScript

- **WHEN** client coverage runs
- **THEN** that module remains in the coverage calculation

### Requirement: Core, messaging and support client modules use strict TypeScript

All production modules under `modules/core/client`, `modules/messages/client` and `modules/support/client` SHALL use `.ts` or `.tsx` with meaningful strict types, while preserving their runtime behaviour, translations, module exports and import compatibility.

#### Scenario: Existing JavaScript callers import migrated platform modules

- **WHEN** a JavaScript caller imports a migrated core, messaging or support module without an extension
- **THEN** the development and production bundles resolve and compile that module
- **AND** client tests can import and exercise it

#### Scenario: Type-checking migrated platform modules

- **WHEN** the client TypeScript check runs
- **THEN** it checks the migrated core, messaging and support modules under strict TypeScript settings
- **AND** the migration does not rely on broad `any` types or TypeScript/lint suppressions
