# developer-tooling Specification

## Purpose

Define build and verification requirements for languages used in Trustroots client code so incremental changes remain testable and visible to CI.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Client TypeScript support

The project SHALL compile client `.ts` and `.tsx` modules used by the current application and SHALL type-check those modules in CI without requiring existing JavaScript to pass TypeScript checking.

#### Scenario: JavaScript imports a converted client utility

- **WHEN** a JavaScript client module imports a converted TypeScript utility without a file extension
- **THEN** the development and production bundles resolve and compile the utility
- **AND** client tests can import and exercise it

#### Scenario: A client TypeScript file contains a type error

- **WHEN** the type-check command runs in CI
- **THEN** the command fails on that error

### Requirement: Client tooling retains TypeScript visibility

The project SHALL include client TypeScript and TSX in linting, test discovery, coverage collection and translation extraction where those tools apply.

#### Scenario: A translated client module is converted to TypeScript

- **WHEN** translation extraction runs
- **THEN** its translation keys are still extracted

#### Scenario: A covered client module is converted to TypeScript

- **WHEN** client coverage runs
- **THEN** that module remains in the coverage calculation
