# A brief guide to the React migration

If you want get familiar with React, start with the [official site](reactjs.org). It has a nice [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

## What do we want to achieve?

We want to have separate codebases for server and client. The client will be written in React.

We'll replace the current AngularJS components one by one. Eventually, we'll drop the AngularJS and create a React project.

### Rationale

- React is more attractive to developers.
- AngularJS is being replaced by newer frameworks.
- [MEAN is not maintained](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/638).
- React is simple and minimalistic; we won't risk getting stuck with a framework like AngularJS again.
- React is not exotic. There is plenty of tooling and documentation available. Lots of folks are already familiar with React.
- It has the potential to help with [React Native](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots-expo-mobile/) implementation of Trustroots. Not necessarily by re-using components but by allowing us to [_"learn once, write everywhere"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeqUPvh8qY).

## How to wire up React components to AngularJS?

Create a react component with a path `modules/**/client/components/SomeName.component.js`. It will get imported to Angular [automatically](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/config/webpack/entries/main.js). Then you can use this component within Angular like `<some-name></some-name>`.
See an [example component](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/modules/pages/client/components/Volunteering.component.js).

_Please note: When you create a React component which is not imported to Angular (i.e. when it's used in other React components only), skip the `component` in the filename - name it just `SomeName.js`._

## Issues and solutions

### Routing

We're using [UI-Router for AngularJS](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/).

The different paths (i.e. [`/volunteering`](https://trustroots.org/volunteering)) are configured in `/modules/**/client/config/**.client.routes.js`.
Look at the [example](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/modules/pages/client/config/pages.client.routes.js) and search for `volunteering` to see how a React component can be added to the router.

#### Links within the app

Where we used `ui-sref` in Angular views, we'll use `href` in React components. This solution reloads the app and therefore is far from ideal.

## Getting Data

### API calls from React

If you need some new data from API, request them directly for React.

Put your methods with API calls to a separate file (i.e. `modules/**/client/components/*.api.js` (this is going to change)). Then import and call these methods in your React component as needed. We're using [`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios) library to make API requests.

```js
import axios from 'axios';

export async function searchUsers(query) {
  return await axios.get(`/api/users?search=${query}`);
}
```

### Passing data from Angular to React

If you need to provide data from Angular to a React component, you can pass them in html attributes. Then they'll be available in the component as `props`.

In AngularJS view it will look like this:

```html
<profile-view-basics profile="profileCtrl.profile"></profile-view-basics>
```

where `profile-view-basics` is a React component imported into AngularJS. We assume that `profileCtrl` is a variable available in the AngularJS view. (Look for `profile-view-basics` in an [example](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/modules/users/client/views/profile/profile-view-basics.client.view.html).)

In React, we use the `profile` in `props`:

```jsx
export default function ProfileViewBasics({ profile }) {
  return (
    <div>
      Username: {{profile.username}}
    </div>
  );
}

// or equivalently, i.e. if you want to use a state

export default class ProfileViewBasics {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Username: {{this.props.profile.username}}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

Read [a manual](i18n.md).

## Testing

Testing is done with [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [`React Testing Library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

React tests are ones that match the path `modules/*/tests/client/components/*.test.js`.

e.g. [modules/core/tests/client/components/LanguageSwitch.component.test.js](../modules/core/tests/client/components/LanguageSwitch.component.test.js)

We loosely follow the philosophy from Kent C. Dodds, summed up as:

> testing using user facing features instead of implementation details

See these two articles by him for more explanation:

- [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)
- [Why I Never Use Shallow Rendering](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering)

## Time scale

We'll have a separate React app by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.
