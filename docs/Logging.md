# Logging

### Server side code

Do not use `console.log/warn/error/info` directly: instead use our logger utility, which is a wrapper for [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#readme)'s `log()` method. Logs are then collected from production server to a centralised place.

While developing, you will see them in Node.js console.

Example:

```js
const log = require('./config/lib/logger');

log('error', 'Example background job failed.', {
  jobId,
  error,
});
```

You can use these log levels `error`, `warn` and `info`.

It's okay to use `console.log/warn/error/info` in CLI scripts, server bootstrapping code and configuration files.

### Client side code

Do not use `console.log/warn/error/info` in files bundled for client side since they would be shipped to our users.

In Angular code, you can use [`$log`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$log) service. Output from this is disabled in production.

There is currently no method to use in React code.

We don't currently record client side error logging to centralised place.
