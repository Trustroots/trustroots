**Accessibility** is important. We want Trustroots to be inclusive. So our websites have to be accessible to blind people.

## WACG 2.0 

WCAG 2.0 is the main standard to follow but unfortunately the documentation at W3C is somewhat convoluted. That's why we try to create a more readable overview of what we need to know to make and keep our site accessible to most people.

## WCAG: three levels

Level A: eliminate major accessibility barriers.

Level AA: a very good level of accessibility.

Level AAA: very meticulous.


Trustroots should first get level A compliance, then work on AA and keep AA. AAA is probably a bit too far stretched.

## WCAG: four principles

### Principle 1: Perceivable
* Text Alternatives: e.g. alt attributes for images
* Time-based Media
* Adaptable
* Distinguishable

### Principle 2: Operable
* Keyboard Accessible
* Enough Time
* Seizures
* Navigable

### Principle 3: Understandable
* Readable
* Predictable
* Input Assistance

###  Principle 4: Robust
* Compatible
