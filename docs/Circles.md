# Circles

## Adding new circle

Circles are added directly to the database manually.

## Adding circle image

Production circle images are kept at [their own repository](https://github.com/Trustroots/circle-images) and manually updated at the production server.

Image requirements:

- Filename should match `slug` value of Circle and end with `.jpg`
- Landscape
- Reasonably sized
- Work with text overlay
- Preferably have humans to be easier to identify with
- Allowed to use non-commercially (E.g. be Creative Commons licensed)
