# Volunteer Chat

We are using Slack for volunteer, day-to-day communications.

[trustroots.slack.com](https://trustroots.slack.com)

Contact [support@trustroots.org](mailto:support@trustroots.org) to ask for joining the chat.

Would be great if you could use your Trustroots username as your Slack username so that people can easily recognise you.
