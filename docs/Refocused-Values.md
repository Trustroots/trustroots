This page is temporary while we discuss our refocused values in March 2017.

## Manifesto

We deeply believe that, given the right context, humans are fundamentally both trustworthy and trusting. We seek to create that context through the worldâ€™s largest digital trust network. We believe that through greater connectedness and deeper trust, humanity will be more peaceful, harmonious, and prosperous.

Summarised in one sentence:

> A more peaceful, harmonious and prosperous humanity through deeper trust.

## Values

* Audacious and experimental
    * We are defined by boldness and urgency. Our goals are outrageously audacious and we are committed to aggressively pursuing them.
    * We believe that radical change only comes from bold experimentation and our approach embraces this ethos.
* Agile and decisive
    * We are nimble, flexible and fast. We move swiftly and update our approach quickly in the face of results.
    * Our team are empowered to make decisions in the pursuit of our clear objectives. We favour decisiveness over consensus and we are not seeking to maximise harmony, we are not afraid to rustle feathers if necessary.
* Consequentialist and rational
    * We are broadly consequentialist: we value actions according to their consequences.
    * We are pursuing colossal goals and we are deeply committed to rational judgement and decision making in the pursuit of our goals.
