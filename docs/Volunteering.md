# Volunteering

## Nostr — decentralized social networking

Online social networks built around the gift economy should rely less on individual-run servers and bureaucratic overhead. Nostr is a promising way to make that vision real. Learn more about [nostr here](nostr.md).


## Support team

We need volunteers to respond to support requests. Although the volume is low, timely and appropriate replies can be important.
Role: Read, triage, and respond to incoming support requests.

- Typical tasks: Answer user questions, escalate bugs, update users on progress, and close resolved tickets.
- Hours & load: Low average volume; availability for occasional swift responses is valuable.
- Skills helpful: Clear written communication, basic troubleshooting, empathy, familiarity with the platform.
- How to start: Join the support channel and review the contribution guidelines in the support repo (or contact the current support coordinator).
- Commitment: Flexible — even a few hours per month or being on-call for short periods helps.

Simply send a message to [support](https://www.trustroots.org/support) if you want to help with this.
