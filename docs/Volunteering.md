_Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do something…_

For some background reading check [Trustroots Foundation](https://www.trustroots.org/foundation) and [Teams](https://www.trustroots.org/team) pages.

Make sure to familiarise yourself with our [volunteer code of conduct](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#readme).

Generally speaking, it's helpful if you have a good tolerance for some kind of chaos. ;) It's easier to work with people who can commit for longer term, who are proactive and _can_ work autonomously. We often work together so good communication skills definitely help.
