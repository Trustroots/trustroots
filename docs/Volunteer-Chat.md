We are using Slack for volunteer, day-to-day communications.

[trustroots.slack.com](https://trustroots.slack.com)

Contact [Kasper](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/guaka) (kasper at trustroots dot org) or
[Mikael](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/mikael) for an account.

Would be great if you could use your Trustroots username as your Slack username so that people can easily recognise you.
