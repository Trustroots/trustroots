# Nostroots

We're working on adding new features to Trustroots thru the Nostr protocol.

Initially this is a replacement of the little used meet functionality:
Users can post notes on pluscode area of a map and soon subscribe to specific pluscode areas. Later these notes can also be related to specific 
[circles](https://www.trustroots.org/circles).

If you're adventurous there's an APK you can try on your android phone.

## Android

### v0.0.1
- [2025-04-18 apk](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/ny9Zqbn45WEoskfAYtAPVm.apk)

These APKs get over-the-air updates for minor things, so the date that shows in the app's settings screen (after enabling dev mode) is probably more recent than this.


## iOS

We will have an iOS testflight available when the [expo map component is more stable](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots/issues/92).
