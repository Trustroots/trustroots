# Nostroots

We're working on adding new features to Trustroots thru the Nostr protocol.

If you're adventurous there's an APK you can try on your android phone.


## Android

- [2025-04-18](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/ny9Zqbn45WEoskfAYtAPVm.apk)

These APKs can get over-the-air updates for minor things, so the date in the app can be more recent than this.


## iOS

We will have an iOS testflight available when the [expo map is more stable](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots/issues/92).


## More information

Check out the [nostroots repo](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots) for more info and if you want to help.
