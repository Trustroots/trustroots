# Nostroots

We're working on adding new features to Trustroots thru the Nostr protocol.

If you're adventurous there's an APK you can try on your android phone.


## Android

- [2025-04-18](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/ny9Zqbn45WEoskfAYtAPVm.apk)

These APKs can get over-the-air updates for minor things, so the date that shows in the app's settings screen (after enabling dev mode) is probably more recent than this.


## iOS

We will have an iOS testflight available when the [expo map is more stable](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots/issues/92).
