## Are you a photographer?
Trustroots needs fresh photos every now and then. Would be great if you could **donate your travel photos** to us! Would be good to have them under some license such as [Creative Commons SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (recommended), but this is not required. Just add them under "Photo donations" title. Add also info how to contact you.

* [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) has a lot of photos as well.

## Adding photos
* General atmosphere in photos should be dreamy, magical, wanderlust. Communicate tranquillity or crazy in a happy way (e.g. laughing friends).
* Landscapes. Make them 1100px wide. Make them hazy blue-green-yellow'ish. [Check toner psd](https://github.com/Trustroots/media/blob/master/photos/photos-color-effect.psd).
* Add photos+credits to [boards directive](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/modules/core/client/directives/tr-boards.client.directive.js). Actual files go to under [core/img/boards/](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/tree/master/modules/core/client/img/board).
* Use them at `board` elements: `<div class="board" tr-boards="['foo', 'bar']"></div>` (will randomly pick one) or just one: `<div class="board" tr-boards="'oneimage'"></div>`.
* At the [blog](http://ideas.trustroots.org]) you can add credits to the caption or at the end of the article. Example:
```html
<small>By <a href="http://example.tld/">Joe Doe</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons</a></small>
```
